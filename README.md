## üéØ The Problem

After a long meeting, it can be time-consuming to re-listen to the recording to extract key decisions, action items, and important takeaways. This manual process is inefficient and can lead to missed details. The AI Meeting Insights Generator solves this by automating the entire process, providing clear, concise, and actionable summaries in seconds.
